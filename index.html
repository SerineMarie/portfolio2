        <p class="description">
          This is the final project exam. I was to create a booking site for
          accomodations in Bergen and also an admin section, where admin can
          create a new accomodation, read messages and bookings sent in. First
          part was to create a local strapi with the content and then make it
          public. Then I chose to use the Nextjs framework, and used axios to
          fetch the content. This site includes some fuctions that doesn't fully
          work yet.

          This project was to learn how to use JavaScript Frameworks. I've
          chosen Next.js. It was used to learn how to make API calls, create
          dynamic routes and make form validation. In this project I'm making an
          API call with a framework of my own choosing. I chose Next.js to fetch
          Mojito recipes and try to display them on a separate page. I've also
          created two forms and added validation to them using components.

        <p class="description">
          This project was done to show what we have learned during our third
          semester. We were to create an e-commerce website with both
          customer-facing and admin sections. We were given an Strapi API to
          fetch our content from. I've used SASS for styling and regular HTML
          and JavaScript for the content.
